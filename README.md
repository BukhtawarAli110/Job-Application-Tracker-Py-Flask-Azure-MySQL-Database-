# JApp Tracker

A minimal web app for managing the `JobsData` table in your `job-tracker`
Azure MySQL database. Supports Create, Read, Update, Delete, and sends
daily email reminders for Day 3 / 5 / 7 follow-ups on applications still
pending a response.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+** installed
- **Azure MySQL firewall:** add your current client IP
  (Azure Portal → your MySQL server → *Networking*)
- **Azure SSL certificate** (required by Azure MySQL).
  Download `DigiCertGlobalRootCA.crt.pem` and place it in the project folder:
  <https://www.digicert.com/kb/digicert-root-certificates.htm>

---

## 2. Setup

```bash
cd "D:/Claude Work - Projects/Job-Tracker-App"

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate            # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate       # Linux / macOS

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy and edit environment variables
copy .env.example .env           # Windows
# cp .env.example .env           # Linux / macOS
```

Open `.env` and fill in:

- `DB_PASSWORD` — your Azure MySQL password
- SMTP section — GMail app password works best
  (create one at <https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords>)

---

## 3. Run

```bash
python app.py
```

Open <http://localhost:5000> in your browser.

To access from your phone/tablet on the same Wi-Fi network:
`http://<your-pc-ip>:5000` (find IP with `ipconfig`).

## 4. Features

| Feature | How to use |
|---|---|
| **View / search** | Home page. Filter by text and status. |
| **Add** | Click "+ New Application" |
| **Edit** | Click "Edit" on any row |
| **Delete** | Click "Delete" (asks for confirmation) |
| **Email reminders** | Sent automatically every day at 09:00 (change `REMINDER_HOUR` in `.env`) |
| **Test email now** | Click "Send Reminder Email Now" button in the header |

Reminder logic: includes applications where
`date_applied` was exactly 3, 5, or 7 days ago AND
`post_status` is still one of `Applied`, `Application Viewed`, or
`Pending Response`.

## 6. Later — Deploying to your Linux server

When you're ready, the process is roughly:

1. Copy the folder to the server
2. Install Python + create the venv there
3. Run under `gunicorn` behind `nginx` as a systemd service
4. Add the server's public IP to the Azure MySQL firewall
5. (Optional) Add auth since it will be reachable from the internet

## 7. Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| `Access denied for user` | Wrong username/password in `.env` |
| `Can't connect to MySQL server` | Your IP isn't whitelisted in Azure Networking |
| `SSL connection error` | `DigiCertGlobalRootCA.crt.pem` missing or path wrong |
| Email doesn't send | Use a **Gmail App Password**, not your Gmail password |
| Table columns don't match | Run `Job-Tracker.sql` first so `JobsData` exists |
